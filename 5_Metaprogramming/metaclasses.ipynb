    "In Python, a metaclass is a class whose instances are classes. Just as an ordinary class defines the behavior of certain objects, a metaclass allows for the customization of class instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaclasses usually enter the game when we program advanced modules or frameworks, where a lot of precise automation must be provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "The typical use cases for metaclasses:\n",
    "- logging;\n",
    "- registering classes at creation time;\n",
    "- interface checking;\n",
    "- automatically adding new methods;\n",
    "- automatically adding new variables.\n",

    "The functionality of the metaclass partly coincides with that of class decorators, but metaclasses act in a different way than decorators:\n",

    "- decorators bind the names of decorated functions or classes to new callable objects. Class decorators are applied when classes are instantiated;\n",
    "- metaclasses redirect class instantiations to dedicated logic, contained in metaclasses. Metaclasses are applied when class definitions are read to create classes, well before classes are instantiated.\n"
